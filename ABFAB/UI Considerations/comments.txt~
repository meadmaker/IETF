This is a set of first impressions and should not be construed as an actual
review of the document.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  1.  Section 4  s/for a user to user a different/for a user to use a
  different/
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Issues:
1. application specific choice of identities
2. separation of ABFAB identities from other GSS-API credentials
3.  Ordering of identity choice for least privilege principles
4.  Identification of non password based credentials - where does the secret
come from?  Credential may or may not be usable based on the state of a plug
in token as an example.

Hi,

here is my review of draft-ietf-abfab-usability-ui-considerations-02.txt.
In general, I've found no difficulties reading it, as it is very clear 
and complete. I have only a few minor comments some nits:

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  * Section 5.1: s/internet/Internet
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  * Section 5.1: A reference to Microsoft Cardspace would be nice.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  * Section 6: s/will need to managed/will need to manage
  * Section 6.1: s/user to authenticate themselves/users to authenticate
    themselves
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


  * Section 7: Does user-driven manual association take precedence over
    automated one? E.g.: when the user decides that a particular IMAP
    server will use ID2 instead of the rule "all IMAP servers will use
    ID1". If so, it might be useful to state it somewhere.
  * Section 11 and 12: Should these sections be moved to the end of the
    document, right before references section?
  * Section 13: A reference to DANE would be nice.

Regards,
Alejandro

Section 3 and 6.
Trust anchor is described as either being the trust anchor for a service
or identity provider.
In section 6 the document talks about trust anchors for servers.
IN the scope of this document we only care about trust anchors for
identity provider.
I recommend narrowing the definition in section 3 and using more
specific terminology in section 6.

Section 6.1
The biggest reason we don't want to store multiple identities with a the
same NAI is that by passing in a NAI to gss_acquire_creds the
application can force the choice of a given NAI.

Section 8:

Section 8 implies that the identity selector will be in a position to
decide what errors to present to the user.
I don't think that's very likely to be true.
The GSS application is likely to decide what errors to present to the
user.

The identity selector is in a position to decide what if any automated
actions to take based on the error.


Section 8/9 should discuss the success but useless case.
That is, I am successfully authenticated and an app layer connection is
accepted, but I don't have the permissions I need.
Think about the case where I was hoping to be a moonshot management
portal admin, but end up being a random user.  I was hoping to create an
organisation but all I can do is create communities.
I'm not sure if it is an error or a success.

I think section 8 and 9 could also do a better job of clarifying what it
means for errors to be reported at different layers.  For example in
SASL, authorization failures will probably not come back as a GSS error,
but instead either as a dropped connection or as an app-level error.

Gents,
  Looked it over. Pretty complete. Just one or two comments.

  Sec 3 talks only of authentication and identity. Are there any use
cases where a user will want some degree of privacy and want to release
attributes (maybe packaged as a "pseudo-identity") to allow
privacy-preserving authentication with authorization to use the service
conveyed in the attributes released? Could the SSH keys be associated
with such a pseudo-identity?
  Sec 6.1 recommends storing the password reset URL for an IdP. I would
assume it won't be a particularly volatile URL, but it may change. Is it
advisable to include it then? Having the help desk URL (presumably even
less volatile) would allow a user to traverse to the password location.
  There is a security considerations section, but no privacy
considerations section. Not sure if that is required now in IETF drafts,
but it would be a worthy addition to this doc given its identity
orientation. It might address the points about Section 3 mentioned above.

  That's it. Maybe the long grind is done. Good luck and enjoy Prague.
             Ken
